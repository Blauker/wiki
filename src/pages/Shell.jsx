                <h4 class=" nosvoid-color d-flex justify-content-center"> What are shells good for?</h4>  <br/> <br/> Shells give unique abilities to our weapon/armor.
                    <br/>
                    There are red shells for weapons, and orange for armor.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                   <h4 class=" nosvoid-color d-flex justify-content-center">Shell and rarity</h4> 
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    What does the level do?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    The shell level specifies the minimum level of our equipment to add features to
                    our equipment. High level shells have more effective properties.
                    <br/>
                    The rarity level of the shell indicates the minimum required level of the
                    equipment. Also, the rarity level is important when adding multiple shells.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    <h4 class=" nosvoid-color d-flex justify-content-center">Shell Bonuses</h4>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    What do the letters S / A / B / C on the shells mean, what are they?
                    <br/>
                    Each option has a letter at the beginning. These mean classification options
                    from the best (the S option can only be found at the highest rarity) to the
                    worst (S A B C)..
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Can I add multiple shells to the same weapon/armor?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Yes you can add. If you want to add a new shell for equipment with an existing
                    shell, the old shell bonus is deleted and a new shell bonus is added.
                    <br/>
                    A shell with a lower rarity level can be added to equipment already equipped
                    with a shell. When you try to add a new shell to a shelled equipment, you have a
                    50% chance of success, the shell will be destroyed on failure. However, the
                    Magic Eraser will give a 100% chance to add a second shell to the equipment.

                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Are there any downsides to adding shells to equipment?
                    <br/>
                    Equipment equipped with a shell becomes exclusive to the owner, only the owner
                    of this weapon can equip it. If you give the gun to someone else, that person
                    cannot use the weapon.
                    <br/>
                    Shell equipment cannot be converted into partner equipment.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>

                    Is there a possibility to use the shell weapon sold / given to someone else?
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    Yes, it is possible to transform the owner of the equipment into yourself by
                    using Perfume. The current shell bonus remains. Perfume can be purchased from
                    NosMall.

                    <br/>
                    Allows you to change the shell equipment owner.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    After the perfume is used on the equipment, the new owner of this equipment
                    becomes the person using the perfume.
