                    There are five tattoo categories (or tattoo patterns), each of them (exept one)
                    has 8 tattoos and every tattoo can be upgraded up to +9. You can choose two
                    different tattoo patterns for your character, but you can't choose the tattoo
                    itself, you will get a random one from the list of the tattoos this pattern can
                    have.

                    <br/>
                    If you don't like the tattoo you've got, you can remove it with :Remove: Tatto
                    Remover
                    <img class="imgtatto" src="asset/tato/tato1.png" alt=""/>
                    <img class="imgtatto" src="asset/tato/tato2.png" alt=""/>
                    <br/>
                    <br/>
                    When you have created a tattoo pattern, you need to apply it on your character.
                    This step as well as all the rest is done by Churisgo, all you need to do is
                    bring her some materials and Gold:

                    When you have applied your tattoo, you can start upgrading it. Every tattoo can
                    be upgraded up to +9. Below you can find a table with all the chances and all
                    the materials needed for upgrades. While upgrading you can come across a major
                    failure, which will make your tattoo level drop by 1. In order to prevent it
                    from happening, you can use a Tattoo Safeguard Scroll
