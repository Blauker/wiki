                    You can make your weapon even more powerful by visiting Martas. You can carve up

                    to your character or not attached to anyone (after carving your first rune it
                    will automatically bind to your character)..

                    Each rune has a different effect. If you get the same effect multiple times, the
                    effect will increase. You cannot choose a Rune, you will only receive a random
                    one. If you are not satisfied with the Rune you have, you can delete all the
                    runes you have with the Rune removal hamme

                    For every 3 runes you carve, there is a chance for a rune power to be applied to
                    your weapon instead of an effect. Just like rune effects, rune powers can stack
                    when you get the same power more than once. There are 10 rune powers, below you
                    can find a list of them. Please note that chances to cast a rune power buff or
                    debuff correspond their levels (which means if you have a level 3 rune power,
                    you have a 3% chance to receive or inflict their buff or debuff). All their
                    buffs and debuffs are level 3.
